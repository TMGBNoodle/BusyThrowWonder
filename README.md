Zombie Throw

A 3D game utilizing NPS created by Sam, Tucker, and Logan for CSCI 370 Interactive Game Development at Hendrix college.

Zombie Throw is a first person zombie combat game, pick up rocks and take out as many zombies as you can. 
Carefuly navigate the map to avoid the growing horde. 

Use WSAD to move forwards, backwards, strafe left, and strafe right. Throw rocks using the space bar, 
the longer you hold the more power you will throw with. Use the mousepad to aim your rocks and release 
the space bar to launch the rock.

The map is based of of a junkyard, with storage containers provding obstacles for the players to help avoid
the zombies. The game is set in aasemi-realistic 3D world, complete with shading.

Some of the joys of making this game were getting the zombies to spawn in correctly and track the player. As well as
getting the rocks to correctly throw. Some struggles we implementing the slider accuratly and getting zombies to respond to gravity correctly.

The art and animation for the characters were taking from Adobe Maximo, with no specific authors listed and the Unity Asset Store.
